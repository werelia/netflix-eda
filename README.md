**Netflix Data Analysis**

Netflix is a subscription-based streaming service that allows our members to watch TV shows and movies on an internet-connected device.   

Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a great source of data to develop data manipulation skills and immerse yourself in the entertainment industry

After cleaning the data, I ran an exploratory data analysis. 

Enjoy!
